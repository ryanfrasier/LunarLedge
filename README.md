# Purpose and Audience: This project is about creating a digital game, with its primary goal being to provide entertainment. It's designed for people who enjoy video games, those that involve navigating a character through various levels by jumping between platforms, similar to well-known games like Mario or Jump King.

# Gameplay Experience: In this game, players will navigate their character through different stages, avoiding obstacles and adversaries along the way.

# Moving Around: Players will control the character's movements using certain keys on the keyboard (WASD). This will allow the character to move forward, backward, and side-to-side within the game's environment.

# Jumping: The character can also jump to avoid obstacles or reach higher platforms, and there's even a special feature that allows the character to jump twice in one go, known as a "double jump".

# Battling Enemies: Along the journey, players will encounter enemies. The character can defend itself and overcome these enemies by using a special attack, which is activated by pressing a particular key (F).

# Health and Progress: The character has a certain amount of health, which can decrease if they are attacked by enemies. However, it can also regenerate over time. If the character loses all of its health, the player can restart from a previously reached checkpoint, so they don’t have to start all over again.

# Player Experience: Players will progress through the game by moving through levels, each of which offers its own unique challenges and adversaries. They'll need to employ strategy and skill to navigate through the world, making use of the character’s ability to move, jump, and attack. As they progress, they will encounter new challenges and possibly discover new abilities or upgrades for their character.

# Game Mechanisms: The game is structured in levels, with each stage introducing its own set of challenges, obstacles, and enemies. Players will navigate their character through these levels, utilizing their abilities to overcome challenges and continue progressing through the game. The experience is designed to be enjoyable and engaging, offering a mix of fun and challenge.
